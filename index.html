        <p id="am-desc">After a decade of working in the Oil and Gas sector - the majority of the time in Project Management - I grew frustrated 
            with inefficiencies in various software and web tools that were being used.  I started out writing VBA macro here and there to optimize an excel sheet, 
            or performing a tweak to one of the internal processes and business systems.  Soon this grew into a passion for designing content that actually
            worked for end users in a clean and efficient manner and evenntually started me on a web development journey.
            <br><br>
            Over the past couple of years I have taken a number of courses in Full Stack Web Design and applied the skills that I learned across various
            projects - this site being one of them.  My engineering background means I love to solve problems in practical ways which I believe is an
            important start point for any web development challenge.
